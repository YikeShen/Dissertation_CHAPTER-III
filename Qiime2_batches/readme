This is the raw data processing of .fastq 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing results
Need the following to run batch
Need some sort of Supercomputing capacity (More memory requirement than local computer)

1. qiime2-xxx.batch (replace xxx with each compartment because average sequencing depth for alpha diversity is different)
2. manifest
3. sampledata.tsv

This pipeline was run in 11/21/2019. 
The version is a little different to today (02/18/2021), please contact me if you would like to get the closest run I did for another study with Qiime2 newer version and newer classifier
I kept this as raw input file for all my analyses.
