In this repository, you will find code for calculation and graphics for each analysis I performed in this paper. 
If you would like to try, please navigate to each folder and download code and input datasheet.
Please see materials and methods for analysis logistics.
Please contact me if you have any questions (ys3419@cumc.columbia.edu)

Attached, you will find the following files:
1. Input datasheets (in either .xlsx or .csv form)
2. R markdown files (.rmd)
3. Jupyter ipython notebook files (.ipynb)
5. Qiime2 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing batch processing file (.batch)
6. Quality control bash file (.bash)
7. Raw sequence file (.fastq) available upon request

Note:download .RMD files and run chunks, I found it is easier to arrange long codes into R Markdown files.
